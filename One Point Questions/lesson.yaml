- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's create a vector containing the numbers 1 through 20 using the `:` operator. Store the result in a variable called my_vector.
  CorrectAnswer: my_vector <- 1:20
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='my_vector <- 1:20')

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Recall that the expression y > 0 will give us a vector of logical values the same length as y, with TRUEs corresponding to values of y that are greater than zero and FALSEs corresponding to values of y that are less than or equal to zero. What do you think y[y > 0] will give you?
  AnswerChoices: A vector of all the positive elements of y; A vector of all the negative elements of y; A vector of all NAs; A vector of length 0; A vector of TRUEs and FALSEs
  CorrectAnswer: A vector of all the positive elements of y
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal="A vector of all the positive elements of y")
  
- Class: mult_question
