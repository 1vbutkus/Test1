- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Create a vector 'z' containing 1000 NAs. (Repeat NA a thousand times)"
  CorrectAnswer: z <- rep(NA, 1000)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='z <- rep(NA, 1000)')
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Use a function to determine whether there are any NAs or where our NAs are located in our data. (Dataset 'my_data')
  CorrectAnswer: is.na(my_data)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='is.na(my_data)')

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Simulate rolling four six-sided dice. (Dont forget that replace = TRUE)
  CorrectAnswer: sample(1:6, 4, replace = TRUE)
  AnswerTests: match_call('sample(1:6, 4, replace = TRUE)')
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: The standard normal distribution has mean 0 and standard deviation 1. Default values for the 'mean' and 'sd' arguments to this function are 0 and 1, respectively. Generate 10 random numbers from a standard normal distribution.
  CorrectAnswer: rnorm(10)
  AnswerTests: omnitest('rnorm(10)')
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now do the same, except with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 25.
  CorrectAnswer: rnorm(10, 100, 25)
  AnswerTests: match_call('rnorm(10, 100, 25)')

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "View the first ten elements of x. (Hint: Don't use functions, only operators.)"
  CorrectAnswer: x[1:10]
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='x[1:10]')

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Now, create a variable called tf that gets the result of which numbers in 'x' are less than 1. (Hint: Don't use functions, only operators.)"
  CorrectAnswer: tf <- x < 1
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='tf <- x < 1')
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: What do you think tf will look like?
  CorrectAnswer: a vector of n logical values
  AnswerChoices: a vector of n logical values; a single logical value
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='a vector of n logical values')
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: ((111 >= 111) | !(TRUE)) & ((4 + 1) == 5)
  CorrectAnswer: 'TRUE'
  AnswerChoices: TRUE; FALSE
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='TRUE')
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Use a function to combine two character vectors that are each of length 1 (i.e. join two words). Try it on these two words: 'Hello', 'world!'. Don't forget the `sep` argument which tells R that we want to separate the joined elements with a single space."
  CorrectAnswer: paste("Hello", "world!", sep = " ")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='paste("Hello", "world!", sep = " ")')

- Class: mult_question
  Output: For simplicity, we usually say that Bernoulli random variables take only the values 1 and 0. Suppose we also specify that the probability that the Bernoulli outcome of 1 is p. Which of the following represents the probability of a 0 outcome? 
  AnswerChoices: p; 1-p; p^2; p(1-p)
  CorrectAnswer: 1-p
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='1-p')
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: Which of the following expressions represents P(A&B), where A is the event of rolling a 3 and B is the event of the roll being odd?
  AnswerChoices: 1/6; 1/2; 1/3; 1/4; 1 
  CorrectAnswer: 1/6
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='1/6')
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: "What's the probability of rolling a '6' twice in a row using a fair die?"
  AnswerChoices: 1/6; 2/6; 1/36; 1/2
  CorrectAnswer: 1/36
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='1/36')

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Consider the random variable X representing a roll of a fair dice. By 'fair' we mean all the sides are equally likely to appear. What is the expected value of X? 
  CorrectAnswer: 3.5
  AnswerTests: equiv_val(3.5)

- Class: mult_question
  Output: True or False? A population mean estimates a sample mean.
  AnswerChoices: True; False
  CorrectAnswer: False
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='False')
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: True or False? A sample mean is unbiased.
  AnswerChoices: True; False
  CorrectAnswer: True
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='True')
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: Suppose you rolled the fair die twice in succession. What is the probability of rolling two 4's?
  AnswerChoices: 1/36; 2/6; 0; 1/6
  CorrectAnswer: 1/36
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='1/36')
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: Is the drawing of a hand of cards continuous or discrete?
  AnswerChoices:  discrete; continuous;
  CorrectAnswer: discrete
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='discrete')

  Output: Each X_i comes from a population with variance sigma^2. What does Sum(Var(X_i)) equal? As before, Sum is taken over n values.
  AnswerChoices: n*(sigma)^2; n*mu; n*E(mu); (n^2)*Var(sigma)
  CorrectAnswer: n*(sigma)^2
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='n*(sigma)^2')
